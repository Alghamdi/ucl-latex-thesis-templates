# UCL LaTeX Thesis Templates

This is a skeletal thesis template with a class and .sty file that you can use separately if you'd prefer.

The class needs some updating and commenting changes which are being worked on, but they're perfectly usable right now.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please do submit an issue, drop me a line, or throw me a pull request.
