# UCL LaTeX Thesis Templates

This is a skeletal thesis template with a class and .sty file that you can use separately if you'd prefer.

The class needs some updating and could use a lot of commenting, and these are being worked on, but the files are perfectly usable right now with pdfLaTeX.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please do submit an issue, drop me a line, or throw me a pull request.
